# Contributing

Please contribute to this site if you have input. We welcome pull requests.

Additionally, the community has noted the following specific needs for input or experimentation:
* Identifying commonalities across communities, organizations, and source data formats
* Performance analysis on a variety of data organizations, analyses and data structure types
* Chunking and compression options in the context of scalable data access to model output
* Data on how optimization decisions vary between different access clients like remote users, dask, and spark clusters
* Provenance -- how to maintain a record of changes as the data gets reformatted and repacked
  * Maintain a src link back to origin
  * When data is broken into granules, how do you identify a singular dataset that comes from an origin?
  * Micro-changes to data -- do these qualify as a completely new version
  * Provenance chaining as data is subsetted, combined, recombined, reformatted going hand to hand.
